Grouter.js For HTML5 Game Creation
=============
  This is a work in progress, not really meant to compete with anything out there but I wanted to build a 
tile engine around tiled. It makes it easy to quickly generate worlds and games in a 2D environment. I would
love if someone would help if you are interested in the project. I am hoping to build it into a npm module
so that it can plugin into express and work right out of the box, both multiplayer and a more simple single
player.

Status
------

  This is really just a hobby project for me to work on and keep learning and possibly use to make a real game or
two in the future. I am looking for contributors to help speed up the process though.

TODO List
--------
- teleport connector
- latency handling
- server side behaviour/interaction definition
- server side npc
