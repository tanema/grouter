Grouter.js For HTML5 Game Creation
=============
  This is a work in progress, not really meant to compete with anything out there but I wanted to build a 
tile engine around Tiled. It makes it easy to quickly generate worlds and games in a 2D environment.

Status
------

  This is really just a hobby project for me to work on and keep learning and possibly use to make a real game or
two in the future. I am looking for contributors to help speed up the process though.

TODO List
--------
- create npc from server and make independant connection
- make independant connection for players as well(channel)
- server side npc
- load new map event and connector
  - unload socket connections
  -
- Better latency handling and checking
- server side validation of interactions
- server side behaviour/interaction definition

ideas
-----
- multiple worlds.
- small worlds that you can wander completely around.
- activate portals to new worlds as you progress.
- maybe have to go to the core to unlock next portal and multidriectional maze to get to the core
- like you some times you have to go furthur away to find a way to the portal.
